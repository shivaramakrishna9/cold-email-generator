## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🧠 AI-Powered Email Drafting:** Leverages Llama 3 to generate persuasive, coherent, and customized email copy.
*   **🎯 Context-Aware Personalization:** Uses ChromaDB to retrieve industry-specific data, case studies, and company info, making every email resonate with the prospect.
*   **⚙️ End-to-End Automated Workflow:** A seamless pipeline from data ingestion and context retrieval to final AI-powered generation.
*   **🖥️ Interactive User Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and easy-to-use experience, no technical expertise required to operate.
*   **🌍 Fully Open-Source:** Built with leading community-driven frameworks and tools, making it transparent and easy to extend.

## 💡 How It Works

The application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver personalized emails:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Domain-specific documents (e.g., your company's case studies, service descriptions, market research) are loaded and processed.
2.  **Embedding and Storage:** The processed text is converted into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers and stored in a ChromaDB vector store.
3.  **Context Retrieval:** When you input a target company and service, the system queries ChromaDB to find the most relevant information from the knowledge base.
4.  **LLM Generation:** The retrieved context is combined with your prompt and fed to Llama 3 via LangChain, which then generates a compelling, personalized cold email.
