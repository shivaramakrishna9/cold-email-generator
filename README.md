## üí° How It Works

The application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver personalized emails:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Domain-specific documents (e.g., your company's case studies, service descriptions, market research) are loaded and processed.
2.  **Embedding and Storage:** The processed text is converted into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers and stored in a ChromaDB vector store.
3.  **Context Retrieval:** When you input a target company and service, the system queries ChromaDB to find the most relevant information from the knowledge base.
4.  **LLM Generation:** The retrieved context is combined with your prompt and fed to Llama 3 via LangChain, which then generates a compelling, personalized cold email.
